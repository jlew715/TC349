My images from Dribbble

1. UI Kit - https://dribbble.com/shots/864910-Ui-Kit?list=searches&tag=flat&offset=0
	UI kits are awesome for web mockups and development, and being a fan of flat, non-skeumorphic designs, this one really floats my boat.

2. "Fireart blog illustration" - https://dribbble.com/shots/1581316-Fireart-blog-illustration?list=searches&tag=flat&offset=9
	Who doesn't like space? The flat design of the objects in the image appeal to me, plus I like the lack of realistic sizing and perspective.

3. "Weather Widget (freebie)" - https://dribbble.com/shots/894214-Weather-Widget-freebie?list=searches&offset=6
	This design, if it were an app, would feel right at home on a Windows phone or tablet. It's a simplistic, flat, no frills design.
