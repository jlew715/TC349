				<h2>Affordance</h2>
				<h3>The Good</h3
				<p><a href="http://www.imgur.com">Imgur's Uploader</a></p>
				<p>Imgur got their uploader just right. It is straightforward and obvious what the user needs to do to upload an image, and gives users 4 easy ways to do so.</p>
				<h3>The Bad</h3>
				<p><a href="http://angel.msu.edu">MSU's Angel</a></p>
				<p>As we are all to familiar with, Angel is pretty horrible. It definitely has some affordance issues. For example, the buttons on the left of the home page once you've logged in. There is a "power" button, which logs you off. In literally every other use of the "power" symbol I've seen, it has something to do with the power state of the device you're using. This is an affordance issue because the button's appearance does not correspond to its function.</p>

				<h2>Mapping</h2>
				<h3>The Good</h3>
				<p><a href="http://eeharbor.com/members/register">EEHarbor's registration page</a></p>
				<p>This registration form is quick, easy, and well-mapped. The submit button is right at the bottom, which is where your cursor will be when you finish the form. Additionally, the form easily fits on one screen so you won't have to scroll to find the submit button.</p>
				<h3>The Bad</h3>
				<p><a href="http://download.cnet.com/WinZip/3000-2250_4-10003164.html">Cnet's Download Pages</a></p>
				<p>Seriously, if you've ever been here you'll know what I'm talking about. There are around 6 download buttons that either download something <em>other</em> than what you're trying to download, or just take you to a different website entirely. This is very confusing and is poor mapping as the download control is obfuscated by fake download controls.</p>

				<h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
				<h3>The Good</h3>
				<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple's home page</a></p>
				<p>Excepting the top navigation, Apple's home page is a perfect example of the rule of thirds. The main featured product takes up the top two thirds, while other hot items are displayed along the bottom third of the page.</p>
				<h3>The Bad</h3>
				<p><a href="http://www.rockauto.com/catalog/catalog.php">RockAuto</a></p>
				<p>RockAuto is an online auto parts store, however their website leaves a lot to be desired. The info/language/contact navigation is squished into the left sixth of the page, with car makes taking up the remaining 5/6 of the page. To make it even worse, in the list of car makes, there is more whitespace than there is content.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Ockham's Razor</h2>
				<h3>The Good</h3>
				<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/meet">Microsoft's Windows 8 page</a></p>
				<p>Microsoft did a great job designing this page to get its point across cleanly and concisely. There is no irrelevant information, and the design is smooth and clean.</p>
				<h3>The Bad</h3>
				<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com">Fox News</a></p>
				<p>Fox News' home page is anything but simple. There are stories in different formats all over the page, some with pictures, links to others in bulleted lists that appear as though they are part of a major story but aren't, and many ads that pretend to be links to news stories. Yuck.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="principle">
				<h2>Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h2>
				<h3>The Good</h3>
				<p><a href="http://www.ford.com/cars/mustang/?gnav=header-cars">Ford's new Mustang page</a></p>
				<p>Ford's page for its 2015 Mustang sports car is very quick and to the point. Except for the top navigation, the page contains only information related to the new car.</p>
				<h3>The Bad</h3>
				<p><a href="http://www.lingscars.com/">Ling's Cars</a></p>
				<p>This site is an abomination. It's hard to tell what is and ad, what is content, and what is just frivolous crap the designer added. It hurts my eyes to even look at the thing. </p>
