            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>I've been in the amateur photography business since the early 2010s, but didn't put a name on it until 2014. It started as taking highschool senior portraits for friends and things just went from there. Now I do photography-for-hire for virtually any occasion.</p>

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I first started experimenting with photography when I was given a point-and-shoot camera for christmas when I was twelve years old. From there I fell in love with taking pictures. In a few years I bought a higher end point-and-shoot and a tripod to get more serious about photography. I discovered that my passion was for landscapes, and macro photography. This was also when the High Dynamic Range (HDR) process was in its infancy, and I was enthralled by the possibilities of the technique. Landscapes have been and always will be my passion, though time has broadened my horions into portraiture as well.</p>
